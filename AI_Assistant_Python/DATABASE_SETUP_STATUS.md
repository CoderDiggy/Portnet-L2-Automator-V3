- **Container duplication detection** (e.g., CMAU0000020)
- **Vessel advice conflict detection** (e.g., MV Lion City 07 VESSEL_ERR_4)
- **EDI message error correlation**
- **API event cascade analysis**

### Your Current Features (Without MySQL):
- ✅ Quick Fix incident analysis
- ✅ RCA with log file analysis
- ✅ Knowledge base search
- ✅ Training data matching
- ✅ Root cause hypothesis generation
- ✅ Timeline building from logs
- ✅ Error pattern detection

## 🔧 If You Want to Enable MySQL (Optional)

### Step 1: Install MySQL
Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
- Choose "MySQL Community Server"
- During installation, set a root password (remember it!)

### Step 2: Create Database
```sql
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE appdb;
EXIT;
```

### Step 3: Import Schema
```powershell
mysql -u root -p appdb < db.sql
```

### Step 4: Update .env File
Edit `.env` and update the line:
```properties
OPS_DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://root:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost/appdb
```
Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your MySQL root password.

### Step 5: Verify
```powershell
python check_database_setup.py
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Program Won't Start?
```powershell
# Check setup
python check_database_setup.py

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python init_database.py
```

### Port Already in Use?
Edit `simple_main.py` and change the port:
```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="localhost", port=8003)  # Change 8002 to 8003
```

### Can't Access from Browser?
- Make sure the program is running (you should see output in terminal)
- Try http://127.0.0.1:8002 instead of localhost
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking port 8002
